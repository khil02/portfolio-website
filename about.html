                    <h2>My story</h2>
                    <p>After moving around the country as a child, my family settled down in North Carolina
                         where I went to college at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. While I 
                         took my programming and video game design classes, I ended up getting my degreee
                          in Business Administration. While in college I worked for a non-profit as their
                          Database Administrator; after college I went into the mortgage industry and became
                          a Mortgage Underwriter. At the start of 2022, my wife changed jobs and became a travelling
                          nurse to let us follow one of our shared passions, travel! Just as that adventure was 
                          starting the housing market took a downturn and I realized that I wanted out of that 
                          industry and into something I enjoyed more and allowed more flexibility. With that goal in mind, 
                          I remembered how much I enjoyed programming in college and decided to make that my new focus.
                          <!-- went back to programming albeit with a broader focus than I had in college.  -->

                    <h2>My skills</h2>
                    <p>
                        My time working as a Database Admin and as a Mortgage Underwriter revolved around problem solving. Whether it was
                        about figuring out how to generate reports from an outdated database, or solving how to transistion to a new, more stable
                        database without losing data or interupting business, it was about solving the problems quickly and efficently.
                        When I was an Underwriter, it was determining how best to qualify a borrower while still meeting the govermental guidelines in a
                        fast and thorough manner. Based on my past experience solving problems, I am ready to apply the same 
                        tenacity to problem solving- with code. 
                        <!-- My career has been about solving problems and programming is just problem solving with code.  -->
